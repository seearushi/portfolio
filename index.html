  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
  <p>I am a designer and researcher. I design interfaces that enable humans to intuitively interact with technology. I speculate a world where these boundaries of interfaces blur. I have studied at the National Institute of Design (NID) and IIIT Jabalpur and currently designing at Brick & Bolt.</p>
